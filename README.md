## Introduction

Contained within this repo is the frontend project for NC News St. This a work in progress as development has only just started.
All data requests will be made to the previously created Backend hosted on Heroku at the link below:

# Starting the app

Initially this app has been coded to start with you logged in as 'jessjelly', one of the registered users.
If you want to use another profile, please log in using one of the following users:

tickle122
grumpy19
happyamy2016
cooljmessy
weegembump
jessjelly

Although the login area allows you to enter a custom username, you will not be able to post any comments. Future development will include only allowing existing usernames to login. Eventually I hope to add profile creation and password functionality, but these are advanced features for after I've finished the Northcoders bootcamp.

Other features to be implemented in future include:
Profile picture
Pagination
Topic creation
Posting of articles
